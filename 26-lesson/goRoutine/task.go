	// 2.Write a program that creates a Go routine to read integers from standard input and send them to a channel. Create another Go routine that reads from the channel and prints the sum of the integers received.

	// 3.Write a program that creates a Go routine to generate random numbers between 1 and 100 and send them to a channel. Create another Go routine that reads from the channel and prints the numbers in descending order.

	// / 5.Write a program that creates a Go routine to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion. Use a channel to communicate the result of the calculation to the main program.
